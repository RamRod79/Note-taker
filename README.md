# Note-taker

## Description

A short description explaining the what, why, and how of project "Employee-Generator":

An application called "Note Taker" that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

Built a back end, connect to an existing front end, and then deployed the entire application to Heroku.

A walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing is included with a link to the video of your project.
